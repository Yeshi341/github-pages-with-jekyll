# Welcome to my blog

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about what brought me to this path of becoming a Data Scientist.

There has been a gap of about 7 years from the time I finished my Masters in Economics Research and today. In the time, my experiences have been as varied and different as the  colors on a rainbow. Each distinct but together meaningful. I believe myself to be a much more wholesome of a person today than I was then. I understand more about myself and my surrounding and I am much more appreciative of everything around me. I have learned to be patient with things I struggle with and to hold on to things that make me a better person and to let go of things that not only conflict with my values but also those things that I have little control over. 
As 2021 slowly unfolds, I hope to be a better person than I was yesterday, and yesteryears and to practise forgiveness towards myself first and to others.
